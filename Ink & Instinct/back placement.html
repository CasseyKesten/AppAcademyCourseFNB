            <h3>BACK PLACEMENT</h3>
            <p>Back placement tattoos are a popular and versatile choice for body art, offering a large canvas that allows for intricate and expansive designs. Because of its size and relatively flat surface, the back is ideal for detailed work, such as full-scale scenes, symmetrical patterns, or sprawling images like wings, mandalas, dragons, or floral arrangements. </p>
            <p>This placement also provides the advantage of discretion, as the tattoo can be easily covered with clothing when desired, making it suitable for both personal expression and professional settings.</p>
            <p>Many people choose the back for meaningful or symbolic tattoos, as its broad area allows the design to unfold in a storytelling manner across the skin. The spine, shoulder blades, and lower back are all common focal points, each carrying their own aesthetic appeal and level of sensitivity.</p>
            <p>While getting a back tattoo can be more painful in certain areas due to proximity to bones or nerves, the result is often a striking and deeply personal piece of art that can evolve with additional elements over time.</p>
            <p>Whether itâ€™s a single large design or a collection of smaller pieces that form a cohesive mural, back tattoos remain a timeless and bold form of self-expression.</p>
