            <h3>TIGER EYES</h3>
            <p>A tiger eyes tattoo is a powerful and visually striking design that symbolizes strength, focus, and an intense sense of awareness. The eyes of a tiger are often portrayed with a piercing, almost hypnotic gaze, capturing the primal essence and raw intensity of the animal.</p>
            <p>In many cultures, particularly in Asian traditions, the tiger is revered as a guardian and a symbol of courage, power, and determination. The tattoo, especially when focused solely on the eyes, magnifies these attributes, suggesting a deeper, spiritual connection to intuition and inner strength. </p>
            <p>The eyes alone can tell a story — of survival, dominance, and silent ferocity — making them a compelling choice for those who identify with resilience and mental fortitude. </p> 
            <p>Artistically, tiger eyes tattoos are often done in realistic black-and-gray or vivid color, with fine detailing that brings the gaze to life, adding a dramatic and intimidating element to the wearer’s body art. </p>
            <p>Whether placed on the forearm, back, chest, or even around the shoulder, the tiger eyes tattoo serves as a constant reminder to stay vigilant, trust one's instincts, and face life's challenges with unflinching resolve.</p>
