            <h3>NECK PLACEMENT</h3>
            <p>Neck placement tattoos are among the most striking and high-commitment types of body art due to their high visibility and symbolic weight. Positioned on one of the most exposed and sensitive parts of the body, neck tattoos can serve as powerful personal statements or aesthetic choices, ranging from small minimalist symbols behind the ear to bold, intricate designs wrapping around the throat or stretching from the collarbone up to the jawline.</p>
            <p>This area offers a unique canvas that accentuates movement and expression, but it comes with certain considerations. The neck has thinner skin, more nerve endings, and less fat, making it a relatively painful spot to tattoo, especially near the spine or jaw. </p>
            <p>Healing can also be tricky, as constant movement and friction from clothing can irritate the area.</p>
            <p>Despite these challenges, many people choose neck tattoos to convey fearlessness, identity, spirituality, or dedication to a lifestyle or belief. Socially, they’ve evolved from being associated with rebellion to becoming mainstream in many creative and alternative circles, though they may still carry professional limitations depending on one's field of work.</p>
            <p>Whether a subtle design behind the ear or a full throat tattoo, neck ink demands thoughtful planning, a skilled artist, and a strong personal reason—making it a deeply expressive and often transformative form of body art.</p>
