            <h3>ROSE</h3>
            <p>A rose tattoo is one of the most enduring and versatile symbols in body art, rich with meaning and aesthetic appeal. </p>
            <p>Often seen as a universal emblem of love and beauty, the rose carries layers of symbolism that vary based on its color, design, and personal context.</p>
            <p>A red rose typically represents passionate love and romance, while a white rose stands for purity, innocence, and spiritual connection. Yellow roses may symbolize friendship and joy, whereas black roses can represent mourning, loss, or even rebellion and strength in the face of adversity.</p>
            <p>The presence of thorns adds depth to the symbolism, suggesting that beauty often comes with pain or that love requires resilience and endurance. Rose tattoos can range from delicate, minimalist outlines to bold, hyper-realistic depictions with vibrant shading and intricate detail, making them a favorite for both first-time ink and experienced collectors.</p>
            <p>They can be placed almost anywhere on the body—often on the arm, shoulder, thigh, or chest—either as a standalone piece or part of a larger composition.</p>
