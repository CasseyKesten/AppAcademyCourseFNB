            <h3>SKULL</h3>
            <p>A skull tattoo is a powerful and evocative symbol that carries a rich array of meanings, often rooted in themes of mortality, strength, and transformation.Ultimately, it's more than just ink on skin; it’s a timeless emblem of life, death, and everything in between.</p>
            <p>While traditionally associated with death and the impermanence of life, a skull tattoo can also signify the courage to face one’s fears and the resilience to survive life’s hardships. </p>
            <p>For some, it’s a reminder of the inevitability of death and the importance of living authentically and without regret.</p> 
            <p>Others may choose a skull tattoo as a mark of rebellion, individuality, or a celebration of overcoming personal challenges. </p>
            <p>The design itself can vary widely—from realistic depictions and sugar skulls inspired by Día de los Muertos, to more abstract or artistic interpretations—each variation adding its own layer of meaning. Whether adorned with roses, flames, or clockwork, a skull tattoo often tells a deeply personal story about the wearer’s journey, beliefs, and identity.</p>
