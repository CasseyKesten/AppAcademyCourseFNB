        <p><h1>Rules are meant to be rewritten!</h1></p>
        <p>Tattoos are sacred markings, prayers inked in silence, reminders that the body is a temple of stories, struggles,and awakening. Each symbol, each word, holds the weight of a soul's journey, a truth too deep for speech. They are mantras worn with intention, talismans of healing, protection, and purpose, etched not just on skin, but on spirit. Today, tattoos are widely accepted and popular, with many people choosing them as a form of personal expression, whether to commemorate important life events, showcase creativity, or simply as a fashion statement. While the meanings behind tattoos can vary greatly, they continue to be an enduring form of self-expression and artistry.   </p>
